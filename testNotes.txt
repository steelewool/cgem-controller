git checkout simulator

Changed port to ./pty1

Started socat with:

socat -v -D -d -d PTY,link=./pty1 GOPEN:/dev/ttyUSB0 3> x.out

In a second terminal python cgemObserveMessierObjects.py


The program first spit out 'Comm not working and then continued to
communicate. Telesdcocpe did not spit out the a# like it was supposed
to.

The 'Attempting to parse read_until seemed in an infinite loop.

The socat line I'm using doesn't appear to be displaying data from the
telescope.

Tried without socat and change cgemObserveMessier.py to use /dev/ttyUSB0
Getting input from the telescope this time.

After adding back in the two byte read into cgemInterface the loop
with the 1 second delay looking for 0# started working

Telescope drove to the postion of M82 as expected.

Given the following inputs:

The telescope drive to a declination of -69 degrees. So my convesion
to cgem declination values is in error.
