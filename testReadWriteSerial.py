# This is using two serial to USB cables connected together with a
# null modem and gender bender connector. It worked on 9/10/2018.
# This has the disadvantage of using two usb ports and required two
# cables. But I feel it is more real life than the loop back test
# done with haywires.

print 'ser0.name : ', ser0.name    # check which port was really used
print 'ser1.name : ', ser1.name
